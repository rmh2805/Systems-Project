A quick overview on our permissions scheme:

Each file and directory has 3 types of permissions, read, write, and meta.

Meta permission controls the ability to modify the entry's position within the 
file system (e.g. removing or moving it), and is held by the file owning user,
root, and sudoed users.

Read and write permissions control the ability to (shock) read and write from/to
entries. These are divided into three layers: user, which controls the owning 
user's permissions; group, which controls the owning group's permissons; and 
general, which controls access to all non-owners.

Other notable elements:
    - users may only set their working directories to directories where they 
      have read permissions
    - root users are members of all groups within the filesystem
    - sudoed users are able to bypass most permission checks within the system,
      with the exception of checks on setgid and setuid
   
    - Group 0 is defined as a group whose only members are root and the file's 
      owner
    - Group 1 is defined as a group with total membership (every user is a 
      member of group 1)
    - Group 2 is defined as the sudo group, and its membership is defined in the
      main "/.groups" file

    - Only the root user can make use of the setuid syscall to change their uid
    - Only the owning user, sudoers, and root may kill any given process.
